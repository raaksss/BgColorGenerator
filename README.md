# Color Flipper 
This project implements a simple color flipper web application. When the user clicks the "Click me" button, the background color of the page will change to a randomly selected color. The selected color's name or hex value will be displayed below the button.

## Usage
* Open the index.html file in your web browser.
* Click the "Click me" button to change the background color.

## How it Works
* When the "Click me" button is clicked, the simple.js script generates a random number to select a color from the colors array.
* The background color of the webpage is set to the selected color, and the color's name or hex value is displayed below the button.

### Feel free to explore and modify the colors in the colors array to customize the color options for your application. Enjoy flipping colors!
